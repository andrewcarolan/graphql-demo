# GraphQL API demo

An example of a GraphQL API using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.

To generate and seed the database and run the API:

```
  npm i && npm run setup && npm start
```

Then navigate to the local URL in your browser to see the GraphQL Playground.
